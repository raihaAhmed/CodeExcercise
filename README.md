Balsamiq project link https://raihaahmed.mybalsamiq.com/projects to access all the mockups made for the project. _I will remove the access as website as soon as needed_. I have included Bmml files of four of the main pages : "gallery-2, Main, Draw",  in the folder under mockups and the rest are on the link above.

### 2.Graphic Design
####Tool used: Photoshop
I have included one photoshop file for the design for View Gallery Scenerio of Gallery page. _Please note when using Gimp some of the color overlays were not showing up, hence I would suggest opening it in photoshop_.

## 3.Code
####Tool used: Webflow
Online version is available at http://blank-site1408095659083.webflow.com. I implemented the graphic design for the view Gallery.I have also included project files under code folder.  Once the repository is cloned,  simply run index.html file in the Code folder to see the web design.

_To clone use the master branch, the other branch was created by me to get to know git and github_.
